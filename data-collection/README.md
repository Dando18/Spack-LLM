# Data Collection

Scripts for collecting and formatting the data set.


### Notes for a Future Iteration

- sections in CLM prompt should be split by `<keyword> ...` or `<keyword> ... </keyword>` and not just `keyword:`
- `, sha256=''` strings can probably be pruned out. they take up a lot of unnecessary tokens and are gonna have to be replaced anyways.
